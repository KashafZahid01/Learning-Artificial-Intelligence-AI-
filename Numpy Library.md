# **NumPy library:**



### **What is NumPy?**

*NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source Python library used for numerical computing.*



It provides support for:

* Multidimensional arrays (ndarrays).
* Mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
* Tools for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, statistics, and more.





### **Why is NumPy Used?**

*NumPy is used for efficient numerical operations in Python.*

### **Why is NumPy Important?**

##### **1. Performance:**

* NumPy is implemented in C under the hood → it's much faster than using regular Python lists.



##### **2. Essential for Data Science \& ML:**

* Libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV are built on or work closely with NumPy.



##### **3. Handles Big Data:**

* NumPy arrays are memory-efficient and can handle millions of data points easily.



##### **4. Broadcasting:**

* Allows operations between arrays of different shapes — very powerful and clean coding style.
