# **WHAT ARE MEASURES OF POSITION?**

*"Measures of Position help us understand the relative location of a particular data point in a dataset."*



### **Three Core Measures of Position:**

1. Z-Score.
2. Percentile.
3. Quartile.



#### **1. Z-Score (Standard Score):**

*The Z-score tells us how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the dataset.*

&nbsp;                                                             

##### &nbsp;**Formula:**

                                \_ 

Z= X−μ /σ (population) or Z =X−x/s (sample)



**Where:**

X = data point.

μ = population mean.

σ = population standard deviation.

\_

x,s = sample mean and standard deviation.



**Interpretation:**

**Z-score:           Meaning**

0                  Data point is exactly at the mean

+1                 One standard deviation above the mean

-1                 One standard deviation below the mean

+2.5               Much higher than average

-2.5               Much lower than average



###### **Example:**

Mean = 70, SD = 10, A student scored = 85
Z =85-70/10  =1.5


#### **2. Percentile:**
*A percentile tells you the percentage of values in the dataset that are below a certain value.*

###### **Example:**
In a class of 100 students, your score ranks 88th.
Then you're in the 88th percentile, meaning:
You did better than 88% of the class.

##### &nbsp;**Common Percentiles:**
25th percentile = Lower Quartile (Q1)
50th percentile = Median (Q2)
75th percentile = Upper Quartile (Q3)


#### **3. Quartiles**
*Quartiles divide a sorted dataset into 4 equal parts — each part represents 25% of the data.*

**Types of Quartiles:**

**Quartile:              Position                               Meaning**
Q1                       25th percentile                        25% of data is below Q1
Q2                       50th percentile                        50% of data is below Q2
Q3                       75th percentile                        75% of data is below Q3


**Interquartile Range (IQR):**
IQR=Q3−Q1
Used to measure spread of the middle 50% of data.

###### **Example:**
For data:
[5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40]
Q1 = 12.5 (25% point)
Q2 = 22.5 (Median)
Q3 = 32.5 (75% point)
