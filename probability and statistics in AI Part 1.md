### **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines or systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.



#### **Why learning Statistics and Probability in AI?**

Probability and Statistics are foundational to learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) because they provide the mathematical and logical tools needed to make informed decisions from data, handle uncertainty, and learn patterns.



# **Descriptive Statistics and Probability:**



### **1.Descriptive Statistics:**

*"Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and organize data so it can be easily understood."*

#### **Examples:**

1.Summarizing test scores in a class with an average.

2.Describing the frequency of events using graphs or tables.

#### **Key Components:**

1.Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode)

2.Measures of Dispersion (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation)

3.Data Distribution (Skewness, Kurtosis)

4.Visualization Tools (Histogram, Box Plot, Pie Chart)



### **2.Probability:**

*"Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur."*

*Range: 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).*

#### **Types:**

1.Theoretical Probability – Based on reasoning (e.g., coin toss).

2.Empirical Probability – Based on actual data (e.g., weather records).

3.Conditional Probability – Probability of event A, given that B has occurred.









### **Data and its type:**



1. #### **Structured Data:**

* Organized into rows and columns.
* Easy to store and analyze.



**Example:** Spreadsheets, SQL databases.









#### **2. Unstructured Data:**

* No pre-defined format. Includes text, images, audio, video.
* Harder to analyze.



**Example:** Emails, social media posts, YouTube videos.









#### **3. Quantitative Data (Numerical):**

*"Quantitative data is measurable and expressed in numbers."*

#### **Types:**

##### **1.Continuous Variables:**

* we Can take any value within a range.
* Examples: Height (172.3 cm), Weight (65.5 kg), Temperature (36.6°C)
* Can be broken down into smaller parts: 1.1, 1.01, 1.001, etc.



##### **2.Discrete Variables:**

* Can take specific values only, usually integers.
* Examples: Number of students (25), Number of cars (3)
* Cannot have fractional values.











#### **4. Qualitative Data (Categorical):**

*"Qualitative data is non-numeric and describes qualities or characteristics."*

#### **Types:**

1. ##### **Nominal:**

* Categories without any order.
* Examples: Gender (Male/Female), Blood group (A, B, O, AB)



##### **2. Ordinal:**

* Categories with a logical order.
* Example: Ratings (Poor < Average < Good < Excellent), Class Rank



##### **3.Binary:**

* Only two possible values.
* Example: Yes/No, True/False, 0/1
