# **Introduction to Pandas:**

# **What is Pandas?**

*Pandas is a powerful Python library used for data analysis, data manipulation, and data cleaning.*



##### **Word history:**

* The name “Pandas” comes from “Panel Data”, which refers to multi-dimensional structured data.
* It is built on top of NumPy, and works well with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.





# **Why is Pandas Used?**

Pandas is mainly used to:

| Use Case       | Description                                 |

| ---------------| ------------------------------------------- |

| Load Data      | Read data from CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, etc.  |

| Clean Data     | Handle missing values, remove duplicates    |

| Analyze Data   | Summarize, group, and filter data           |

| Transform Data | Add, update, or delete columns and rows     |

| Visualize      | Use with Matplotlib or Seaborn for plotting |

| Export         | Save clean data back to CSV, Excel, etc.    |







# **Why is Pandas Important?**



| Reason             | Explanation                                   |

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |

| Easy to Use        | Works like Excel tables but in Python         |

| Powerful           | Can handle large datasets easily              |

| Fast               | Built on NumPy, optimized for performance     |

| Flexible           | Works with different formats: CSV, Excel, SQL |

| Integration        | Works with AI/ML libraries like Scikit-learn  |

| Industry Standard  | Widely used in data science jobs              |





##### **Examples:**

| Use Case  | Example                                    |

| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |

| Banking   | Analyzing customer transactions            |

| Health    | Tracking patient records and lab results   |

| Marketing | Analyzing social media or ad campaign data |

| Retail    | Managing sales and inventory data          |

| Education | Analyzing student grades and attendance    |







# **Why Pandas is Important in Learning AI:**

* Pandas is a foundational tool in data science and machine learning — and both are core components of AI.
* Before you can train any AI model, the first and most critical step is working with data — and that’s exactly where Pandas comes in.





1. ### **AI is all about data — and Pandas is a data expert:**



* AI systems learn patterns from data like(loading data, fixing missing and incorrect value, analyzing data, prepare data for training etc).





### 

### **2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Before building AI, you must understand the data:

* Is there a pattern?
* Are there outliers?
* What features are most important?







### **3.Pandas works with Machine Learning Libraries:**

* You can easily pass Pandas DataFrames to AI libraries like(Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / Keras, PyTorch etc).
